My name is Weiqiu You (尤玮秋). I am a 5th year PhD student in Computer and Information Science at University of Pennsylvania, advised by [Prof. Eric Wong](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~exwong/).
Previously, I was advised by [Prof. Mohit Iyyer](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~miyyer/) while I was a Master's student at UMass.
 <!-- [Prof Jon May](https://www.isi.edu/~jonmay/) while I was an intern at USC/ISI, and [Dr. Youngja Park](https://research.ibm.com/people/youngja-park) while I was an intern at IBM Research. -->

I am broadly interested in trustworthy and explainable machine learning, with an extra focus of interest in AI for medicine. Currently I'm building explainable models for safe surgeries.
