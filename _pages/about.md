My name is Weiqiu You (尤玮秋). I am a final year PhD student in Computer and Information Science at University of Pennsylvania, advised by [Prof. Eric Wong](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~exwong/).
Previously, I was advised by [Prof. Mohit Iyyer](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~miyyer/) while I was a Master's student at UMass.
 <!-- [Prof Jon May](https://www.isi.edu/~jonmay/) while I was an intern at USC/ISI, and [Dr. Youngja Park](https://research.ibm.com/people/youngja-park) while I was an intern at IBM Research. -->
I have interned at Meta, OIST, IBM Research, USC ISI.


I am interested in:
- Trustworthy ML
- Faithful and Verifiable Explanations for ML
- Evaluation Benchmarks in Expert Domains
- LLM Reasoning
- ML for Cosmology and Surgery

Here is my [CV](/assets/pdf/weiqiu_you_cv.pdf).

Some random essays in my [blog](https://valley-manatee-f47.notion.site/Blogs-2156e4d4139380efbe88f03ff15eb53f).

_I am actively looking for postdoc and research scientist positions starting fall 2026._
