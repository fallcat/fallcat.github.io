My name is Weiqiu You (尤玮秋). I am a 4th year PhD student in Computer and Information Science at University of Pennsylvania. I am advised by [Prof. Eric Wong](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~exwong/).

Previously, I was very fortunate to have worked with [Prof. Mohit Iyyer](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~miyyer/) while I was a Master's student at UMass, [Prof Jon May](https://www.isi.edu/~jonmay/) while I was an intern at USC/ISI, and [Dr. Youngja Park](https://research.ibm.com/people/youngja-park) while I was an intern at IBM Research.

I am broadly interested in
- Machine learning
- Explainable AI
