My name is Weiqiu You (尤玮秋). I am a third year PhD student in Computer and Information Science at University of Pennsylvania advised by Prof. Eric Wong. I was very fortunate to have worked with Prof. Mohit Iyyer while I was a Master's student at UMass, Prof Jon May while I was an intern at USC/ISI, and Dr. Youngja Park while I was an intern at IBM Research.

I am broadly interested in machine learning and explainable AI.
