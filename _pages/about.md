My name is Weiqiu You (尤玮秋). I am a second year PhD student in Computer and Information Science at University of Pennsylvania working with Prof. Mark Yatskar. I was very fortunate to have worked with Prof. Mohit Iyyer while I was a Master's student at UMass, Prof Jon May while I was an intern at USC/ISI.

I am broadly interested in investigating natural language processing and machine learning, with specific focuses on the intersection between natural langauge processing and computer vision, dialog, reasoning, and multilinguality.
